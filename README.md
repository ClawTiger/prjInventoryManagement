Pointer types in C# are variables that display the allocated memory address of the variable type that it is assigned to (Rajesh, 2023). In the language of C#, pointer types can only be assigned to hold the memory address of arrays and value types such as integer (Rajesh, 2023). A pointer type in C# can be declared by adding an asterisk (int*) next to a variable type (Microsoft, 2025). The main function of a pointer is to access the memory address of the variable it is assigned to (Microsoft, 2025). Pointers require an unsafe context as by default *safe* code doesn't use any pointers or free access of memory (Microsoft, 2025). The unsafe context does not verify the code and allows for direct memory access by using pointers, which is why pointers need to be used in an unsafe context (Microsoft, 2025).
